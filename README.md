# CNN-Research (Overview)

This repository hosts the culmination of my Master's research at 
UC Davis in Electrical Engineering/Digital Signal Processing. 

I took part in a research project in association with the department 
of water resources (DWR) and helped to design a Convolutional Neural 
Network trained (CNN) on data provided by DWR. This purpose of this
CNN is to improve the training of other networks designed for DWR by 
helping to fill in missing data. The idea is to use machine learning
to predict what the missing data would most likely be. With the data 
now filled in, it can be used by other Machine learning programs to 
make better informed predicitons.

```

This action should promp you for your ssh key password. Type your
password and allow the download to complete
